	* gsf/gsf-utils.h : Use the glib type macros instead of defining our
	  own.

 	* doc/Makefile.am: Introduced DOC_DIR so the location can be easily
 	overridden when building packages.
 	* debian/*: Preliminary Debian packaging.

	* gsf/gsf-infile-msole.c (ole_info_read_xbat) : DOH!
	  We need to check endianness when reading the bat elements.
	(gsf_infile_msole_read) : slow but effective work around for
	  breaking at block boundaries.  I'll work up something faster this
	  evening.

	* Start making this into a real package.
