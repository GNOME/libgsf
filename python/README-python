These are Python bindings for libgsf.

The bindings require gnome-python 1.99.10 or later. Building from CVS
requires a little manual intervention: 

- Remove 'dnl' from the beginning of the lines from AM_PATH_PYTHON
  down to the next line of asterisks in ../configure.in.
- Overwrite ../acinclude.m4 with ../acinclude.m4.am15
- Overwrite Makefile.am in this directory with Makefile.am15.
Then you may run autogen.sh.

The reasons for this setup are historical; these files should be merged.

Python 2.2 is required because gnome-python requires this. If you have
Python 2.2 installed with another name, e.g. /usr/bin/python2.2, you
can configure gnome-python and libgsf like this (assuming bash):

PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.2 ./configure

Gnumeric must be configured with the same Python version in order to
be able to use the Python gsf module. But the binary is specified in a
different way:

./configure --with-python=python2.2

Sorry about that!

ex-1.py is a simple example.
