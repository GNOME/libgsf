Description: Structured File Library - development files for GNOME
 This package contains the development files used in building applications
 that use the GNOME Structured File Library.
 .
 The GNOME Structured File Library library aims to provide an efficient
 extensible I/O abstraction for dealing with different structured file
 formats. It is actively being developed and its API is still likely to
 undergo significant changes (in particular, extensions).
 .
 This package supports the use of Bonobo, GNOME's CORBA-based component
 architecture and of GNOME-VFS, the GNOME virtual file-system.

Description: Structured File Library - development files (basic version)
 This package contains the development files used in building applications
 that use the GNOME Structured File Library.
 .
 The GNOME Structured File Library library aims to provide an efficient
 extensible I/O abstraction for dealing with different structured file
 formats. It is actively being developed and its API is still likely to
 undergo significant changes (in particular, extensions).
 .
 This is the basic development package for the GNOME Structured File library.
 It is not GNOME-specific and thus does not depend on GNOME libraries. 
 For GNOME-specific extensions, use libgsf-gnome-1-dev.
